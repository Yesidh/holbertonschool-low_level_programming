- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs
## Examples                     
## Prerequisites                                                                
- Search algorithm
- Space complexity (1)

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic                                             
```                                                                             
## Installing                                                                   
                                                                                
for have the code in your local machine you only need download the code files and put it into a directory.
## Built With                                                                   
                                                                                
gcc 4.8.4 and ubuntu 14.04
